# Antimicrobial resistance in patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis

## Purpose of this repository

This repository contains all data and code necessary to reproduce the analyses presented in the manuscript "[Antimicrobial resistance in patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2666-5247(22)00355-X)" by Langford et al. (doi: [10.1016/j.cmi.2022.12.006](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2666-5247(22)00355-X)). **This includes every table and figure except for figure 1, supplementary table 1 and supplementary table 3. Supplementary table 1 is a subset of the dataset found in the file `data.csv`. Supplementary table 3 is also calculated from this dataset.** Note that the included scripts produces additional figures beyond those directly presented in the manuscript.

For more details on the methodological approach used in this meta-analysis, please see the manuscript [Meta-analysis of Proportions Using Generalized Linear Mixed Models](https://doi.org/10.1097/EDE.0000000000001232) by Lin & Chu (2020). Sample code is also provided.

## Requirements

All code is written in the programming language [R](https://www.r-project.org/). The easiest way to run it is to use the [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) IDE. An `.Rproj` file is included with this repository for ease of use with RStudio. The scripts should run with any modern version of R.

The R packages required to reproduce the tables and figures at listed at the top of their respective scripts. They must be installed using `install.packages` or similar functionality within RStudio prior to running the script.

## Reproducing tables and figures

Run `analysis.R` to create the output tables and figures.

## Tables
