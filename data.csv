IgM in patients with clinical criteria for COVID-1918. The diagnosis of bacterial or fungal infection was made following standard laboratory procedures19. The microorganisms were identified by MALDI-TOFÂ® mass spectrometry (Bruker DaltonikÂ®, Bremen, Germany). The diagnosis of infection was based on the clinical symptoms, the isolation of an etiological agent and the assessment of the group of clinicians responsible for the patient. Bacteremia / fungemia was defined as the isolation of a pathogen in one or more blood cultures and for microorganisms of the skin flora, its growth was assessed in two or more blood cultures extracted by different routes. For catheter-associated bacteremia (CAB), the isolation of the same microorganism in blood and at the catheter tip (count â‰¥ 103 CFU) from samples obtained in parallel or in two blood cultures taken simultaneously from the catheter and by venipuncture was assessed. Respiratory infection (IR) was considered the significant isolation of a potentially pathogenic microorganism in a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), in a bronchial aspirate (BAS) or in a titratable sputum (> 25 PMN and <10 epithelial cells Ã— 100) or the detection in urine of the antigen of Streptococcus pneumoniae by immunochromatography using BinaxNOWÂ® (Abbot Diagnostics ScarbourgÂ®, Maine, USA). For the diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, the algorithm of Armstrong-James et al.21 was followed. Urinary tract infection (UTI) was defined as the significant isolation19 of a micro-organism in the urine sample of a patient with signs and / or symptoms of infection. The diagnosis of skin and soft tissue infection (IPPB) was based on the Gram stain (PMN and presence of bacteria or fungi) and the agreement with the result of the culture. The infections were classified as co-infections or superin- fections. Coinfection was defined as community-acquired infection diagnosed in the first 48 h after hospital admission by COVID-19.
